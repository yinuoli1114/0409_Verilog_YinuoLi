2. Jason helped me on understanding the overall design architecture and helped me debug for the avg_four.sv. I helped him to debug his flex_counter.sv which had logic problem. We tested the overall design together

3. We met twice. We texted to each other to set up the meeting time.

4. I helped Jason on debugging flex_counter.sv, I helped him to figure out how to debug through the waves simulated by the given test bench.

5. Jason helped me on understanding the overall design architecture and helped me debug for the avg_four.sv. He also figured out one dignificant error in the mapped part which impeded the data input. I learned from Jason that how the overall desgin architecture works.
