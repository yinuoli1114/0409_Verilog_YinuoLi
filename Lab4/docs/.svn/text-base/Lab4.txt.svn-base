Question 1: 
  What is the minimum amount of time that data_ready must remain asserted to ensure correct operation? 
   3 clock cycles, synchronizer needs 2 clock cycles

  What is the minimum amount of time, in clock cycles, that data must remain valid after data_ready is asserted in order to ensure correct operation? (You may assume that all setup and hold times, as well as any propagation delays, are negligible.)
   1 clock cycle

Question 2:

idle: if(dr == 0) goto idle
store: if(dr == 0) goto eidle
       reg[7] = ext_data
sort1: reg[1] = reg[2]
sort2: reg[2] = reg[3]
sort3: reg[3] = reg[4]
sort4: reg[4] = reg[5]
add1: reg[6] = reg[1] + reg[2]
      if(overflow) goto eidle
add2: reg[7] = reg[3] + reg[4]
      if(overflow) goto eidle
add3: reg[0] = reg[6] + reg[7]
      if(overflow) goto eidle

eidle: err = 1
       if(dr == 1) goto store
       if(dr == 0) goto eidle

Question 3:
   The filtered image is more blurred than the original image. Because the filtered image actually takes the pixels fro.m the original image and divide them by four so that the color looks evenly.

Question 4:
   fscanf,fseek,fopen,fwrite,ftell,fatal

Question 5:
    specifier:i,d,o,x,f,a,c,s,p,[a-z],n,%
